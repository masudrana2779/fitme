You may view the FITME GLOBAL content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content.

The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "Account" page.</li>
                                    <li>IV. The FITME GLOBAL service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces, promotional features and availability of FITME GLOBAL content. You can turn off tests participation at any time by visiting the "Account" page and changing the "Test participation" settings.</li>
                                    <li>V.  Some FITME GLOBAL content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on certain supported devices (“Offline Titles”). Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long the Offline Titles will remain accessible.

You also agree not to: circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the FITME GLOBAL  service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the FITME GLOBAL  service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the FITME GLOBAL  service; insert any code or product or manipulate the content of the FITME GLOBAL  service in any way; or use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method.

                                    <li>VII.    The quality of the display of the FITME GLOBAL content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD or HDR and not all subscription plans allow you to receive content in all formats. Default playback settings on cellular networks exclude HD, Ultra HD and HDR content. The minimum connection speed for SD quality is 0.5 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. A download speed of at least 5.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher). A download speed of at least 25.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD (defined as a resolution of 1080p or higher) and HDR content. You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching FITME GLOBAL content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected and the configuration of your FITME GLOBAL ready device.</li>
                                    <li>VIII.
